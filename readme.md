This project simulates the motion and interactions of Bristlebots in a confined arena. Bristlebots are small, self-propelled robots with several bristle-like legs and a vibrating motor which drives their motion. Importantly, the bots tend to move in straight lines with small random deviations introduced by interactions between the motor, the bending of the legs, and the interaction of the legs with the floor.
